# Perform-a-Query-With-Splunk

<h2>Activity Overview</h2>

In this activity, I'll be introduced to the Splunk platform. Then, I'll use Splunk Cloud to upload data, perform basic searches on the data, and answer a series of questions.

So far, I've learned that SIEM tools, such as Splunk, are an important part of a security analyst's toolbox because they provide a platform for storing, analyzing, and reporting on data from different sources. I also explored some basic searches using Splunk's querying language, called Search Processing Language (SPL), which included the use of pipes and wildcards.

Creating effective searches is an important skill because it enables me to quickly and accurately find the information I am looking for within a large amount of data. Quick and accurate searching is especially useful during incident response because I might need to swiftly identify and address a security incident. Effective search techniques also help me efficiently identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within data.

<h2>Scenario</h2>

I am a security analyst working at the e-commerce store Buttercup Games. I've been tasked with identifying whether there are any possible security issues with the mail server. To do so, I must explore any failed SSH logins for the root account. 

<h2>Task 1: Perform a Basic Search</h2>

Take a moment to examine the Splunk Cloud interface by locating the app panel, the Explore Splunk panel, and the Splunk bar.

Perform my first query to confirm that the data has been ingested, indexed, and is searchable. Follow these steps to perform a query:

1. Navigate to Splunk Home. (To return to Splunk Home, click the Splunk Cloud logo on the Splunk Cloud page.)

2. Click Search & Reporting.

In the search bar,  enter my search query:

```index=main```

3. This search term specifies the index. An index is a repository for data. Here, the index is a single dataset containing events from an index named main.

4. Select All Time from the time range dropdown to search for all the events across all time.

5. Click the search button. Note that the search button is represented by the magnifying glass icon. My search should retrieve thousands of events.

Pro tip: It's a best practice to use short time ranges in my searches because a shorter time range returns results faster and uses fewer resources. Adjust the time using the time range dropdown or by using time modifiers in Ir search.

<h2>Task 2: Evaluate the Fields</h2>

When Splunk indexes data, it attaches fields to each event. These fields become part of the searchable index event data. This helps security analysts easily search for and find the specific data they need. Now that I've run my first query, examine the search results and the fields.

For each event, the fields are host, source, and sourcetype. Under SELECTED FIELDS, examine the same fields.

Examine the field values by clicking on the field under SELECTED FIELDS. I should observe the following:
host: 

- The host field specifies the name of the network host from which the event originated. In this search there are five hosts:
  - mailsv - Buttercup Games' mail server. Examine events generated from this host.
  - www1 - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.
  - www2 - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.
  - www3 - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.
  - vendor_sales - Information about Buttercup Games' retail sales.
- source: The source field indicates the file name from which the event originates. I should identify eight sources. Notice /mailsv/secure.log, which is a log file that contains information related to authentication and authorization attempts on the mail server.
- sourcetype: The sourcetype determines how data is formatted. I should observe three sourcetypes. Examine secure-2.

<h2>Task 3: Narrow My Search</h2>

Because I've been tasked with exploring any failed SSH logins for the root account on the mail server, I'll need to narrow the search results for events from the mail server. Under SELECTED FIELDS, click host and click mailsv.

Notice that a new term has been added to the search bar: index=main host=mailsv. The search results have narrowed to over 9000 events that are generated by the mail server.

<h2>Task 4: Search for a Failed Login for Root</h2>

Now that I've narrowed my search results to events generated by the mail server, continue to narrow the search to locate any failed SSH logins for the root account. 

1. Clear the search bar.

Enter ```index=main host=mailsv fail* root``` into the search bar.

2. This search expands on the search from the previous task and searches for the keyword fail*. The wildcard tells Splunk to expand the search term to find other terms that contain the word fail such as failure, failed, etc. Lastly, the keyword root searches for any event that contains the term root.

3. Click search.

<h2> Task 5: Evaluate the Search Results</h2>

My search from the previous task should have retrieved search results for over 300 events. Navigate to other pages of the search results to observe the events not listed on the first page of the results.

Pro tip: Splunk highlights search terms in search results to make it easier to identify where the search terms appear in the data.

Over 100,000 events are contained in the main index across all time:

host identifies the name of a network device or system from which an event originates:

vendor_sales is a host used by Buttercup Games that contain log information relevant to financial transactions

There were over 300 failed SSH logins for the root account on the mail server:

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

In this activity, I used Splunk Cloud to perform a search and investigation. Using Splunk Cloud, I was able to:

- Upload sample log data 
- Search through indexed data
- Evaluate search results
- Identify different data sources 
- Locate failed SSH login(s) for the root account

If I would like to challenge myself and explore more simulated incident investigations using Splunk, I can log in to Splunk and visit Splunk Boss of the SOC.
